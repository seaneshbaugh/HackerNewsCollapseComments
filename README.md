# Hacker News Collapse Comments

Just a user script to allow comment collapsing on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). Unlike some other scripts that do the same this one persists across page loads thanks to `window.localStorage`.

## Installation

* Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) in Chrome.
* Drag and drop `HackerNewsCollapseComments.user.js` onto the browser.
